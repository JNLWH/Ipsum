["index.html", "Ipsum Preface", " Ipsum by Jiani 2019-02-18 Preface Bookdown package is a simple way to publish a GitBook look-and-feel online book and turn it into a static wiki site in no time. This is a simple minimum book to test how this works. I used a number of sources during this test: Bookdown by Yihui, RStudio Tidyverse Style Guide by Hadley Wickham Bookdown Starter “Boilerplate” by Sean Kross R Markdown Markdown guide Lorem Ipsum generator Sean’s Starter Master has proven to be invaluable to kick start a simple Book.

["what-is-lorem-ipsum.html", "1 What is Lorem Ipsum 1.1 Ipsum more", " 1 What is Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. 1.1 Ipsum more Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Mauris ac interdum urna. Sed ornare volutpat nisl, rutrum pretium mauris. Fusce at placerat libero. Suspendisse vestibulum libero at dolor efficitur bibendum. Donec venenatis gravida massa eget mattis. Quisque eu urna justo. Suspendisse in pellentesque odio, et vestibulum diam. Donec luctus risus in egestas aliquam. Aliquam volutpat faucibus ante, non viverra leo mollis at. Cras vitae lorem vitae velit scelerisque malesuada. Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique senectus et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas. Nullam mauris neque, ultrices quis tristique a, elementum quis arcu.

["why-do-we-use-it.html", "2 Why do we use it 2.1 Lorem more", " 2 Why do we use it It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). 2.1 Lorem more Donec ac aliquet tortor, tempor dictum arcu. Maecenas efficitur libero sit amet nisl fringilla, at finibus nisl facilisis. Etiam eu vehicula diam. Nulla ultricies pellentesque lorem. Vivamus eget lectus ut dui interdum rutrum. Nulla elementum non velit eget sodales. Vivamus fermentum tellus a pulvinar placerat. Cras leo ipsum, pulvinar et enim sed, tempor consequat metus. Cras non neque vitae urna iaculis condimentum vel quis metus. Donec ipsum risus, elementum vehicula ornare in, consequat et augue. Sed arcu justo, lobortis eget dolor eu, molestie ullamcorper eros. Fusce tincidunt urna vel mi faucibus cursus. Integer vulputate, sem vitae tempus porta, metus lectus tincidunt odio, non posuere arcu augue id ipsum. Donec facilisis euismod lectus malesuada luctus.

["where-does-it-come-from.html", "3 Where does it come from 3.1 Lorem Ipsum more 3.2 And more", " 3 Where does it come from Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from “de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum” by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham. 3.1 Lorem Ipsum more Sed blandit dui eget tortor facilisis, non luctus dolor hendrerit. Donec elementum, sapien in porta mollis, augue ligula tempor libero, ut euismod lorem justo eu felis. Ut quis varius ante. Donec luctus consectetur sapien, in lacinia felis. Morbi quis tellus vel ex rhoncus bibendum. Orci varius natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. Duis sodales nisi ac sapien imperdiet porta. Vestibulum nibh mi, consectetur sed blandit et, egestas a lectus. Integer vitae vestibulum leo. 3.2 And more Cras luctus, dui non aliquam ullamcorper, dui justo gravida ex, id eleifend magna leo quis metus. Nulla placerat tincidunt sodales. Etiam egestas ut nisi ut elementum. Morbi sit amet sem vestibulum, mollis velit ac, pulvinar elit. In dolor quam, lacinia eget finibus et, egestas a purus. Suspendisse dapibus eleifend dolor vitae ultrices. Vivamus efficitur nisl eu neque ultricies vulputate. Suspendisse finibus dolor a malesuada blandit. Vestibulum diam turpis, bibendum sit amet enim et, ornare porttitor nulla. Vestibulum et volutpat nisl. Nunc mauris mi, hendrerit sed justo eu, dapibus cursus sem. Aliquam venenatis luctus ex, vitae cursus metus pharetra quis. "],
["where-can-i-get-some.html", "4 Where can I get some", " 4 Where can I get some There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don’t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn’t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc. "],

Create a new doc/ folder directly under Master branch. Push repo to Github. This repo is hosted on a free account. So the repo is set to public for me to enable Github Pages settings. One needs to go into repo settings to enable github page. 5.2 Bookdown boilerplate Copy or clone Sean’s Bookdown boilerplate (Bookdown-Start Repo). Start with these files and make modifications. 5.2.1 _output.yml Update line 8 “Ipsum” as this will be the book name. 5.2.2 _bookdown.yml Update: book_filename repo (optional) output_dir: docs rmd_files specifies the order of chapters. It helps to name each file with a number prefix. new_session: yes 5.2.3 index.Rmd Write Preface or Introduction. Update: Title Author Date GitHub-repo Url is where the book will be published. I used https://jnlwh.github.io/Ipsum/ to see the final results. Description cover-image (optional, .pgn works) 5.3 Start writing I created page files at once with library(&quot;bookdown&quot;) file.create(&quot;00-My-Bookdown-Step-by-Step.Rmd&quot;, &quot;01-What-is-Lorem-Ipsum.Rmd&quot;, &quot;02-Why-do-we-use-it.Rmd&quot;, &quot;03-Where-does-it-come-from.Rmd&quot;, &quot;04-Where-can-I-get-some.Rmd&quot;) Each file is a “page” on the online book website. Personally I prefer longer pages with subsection (Heading 2, 3, …). For me it’s easier to scroll down with a good menu rather than need to load page after page containing very little content. Headings automatically get to turn into Chapter and subsections with numbering in place. 5.4 Book preview Render book with r code bookdown::render_book(&quot;index.Rmd&quot;) Go into ´docs &gt; index.html` to preview book in Web Browser. Up until now, the book HTML is on the local computer. 5.5 Push code to GitHub Thanks to the docs folder under master branch, once repo is pushed to master the Github Page is live immediately at https://jnlwh.github.io/Ipsum/. After I made some changes, I need to re-render the books and then push to Github for the changes to show on the Github Page. "]
