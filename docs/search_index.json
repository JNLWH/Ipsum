["index.html", "Ipsum Preface", " Ipsum by Jiani 2019-02-18 Preface Bookdown R package is a simple way to publish a GitBook look-and-feel online book and turn it into a static wiki site in no time. This is a simple minimum book to test how this works. I used a number of sources during this test: Bookdown by Yihui, RStudio Tidyverse Style Guide by Hadley Wickham Bookdown Starter “Boilerplate” by Sean Kross R Markdown Markdown guide Lorem Ipsum generator Sean’s Bookdown starter boilerplate has proven to be invaluable to kick start this simple book.

["my-bookdown-step-by-step.html", "1 My Bookdown step-by-step 1.1 A new R project “Ipsum” 1.2 Bookdown boilerplate 1.3 Start writing 1.4 Book preview 1.5 Push code to GitHub", " 1 My Bookdown step-by-step 1.1 A new R project “Ipsum” Create a new project in R Studio. Create a new doc/ folder directly under Master branch. Push repo to Github. This repo is hosted on a free account. So the repo is set to public for me to enable Github Pages settings. One needs to go into repo settings to enable github page. 1.2 Bookdown boilerplate Copy or clone Sean’s Bookdown boilerplate (Bookdown-Start Repo). Start with these files and make modifications. 1.2.1 _output.yml Update line 8 “Ipsum” as this will be the book name. 1.2.2 _bookdown.yml Update: book_filename repo (optional) output_dir: docs rmd_files specifies the order of chapters. It helps to name each file with a number prefix. new_session: yes 1.2.3 index.Rmd Write Preface or Introduction. Update: Title Author Date GitHub-repo Url is where the book will be published. I used https://jnlwh.github.io/Ipsum/ to see the final results. Description cover-image (optional, .pgn works) 1.3 Start writing I created page files at once with library(&quot;bookdown&quot;) file.create(&quot;00-My-Bookdown-Step-by-Step.Rmd&quot;, &quot;01-What-is-Lorem-Ipsum.Rmd&quot;, &quot;02-Why-do-we-use-it.Rmd&quot;, &quot;03-Where-does-it-come-from.Rmd&quot;, &quot;04-Where-can-I-get-some.Rmd&quot;) Each file is a “page” on the online book website. Personally I prefer longer pages with subsection (Heading 2, 3, …). For me it’s easier to scroll down with a good menu rather than need to load page after page containing very little content. Headings automatically get to turn into Chapter and subsections with numbering in place. 1.4 Book preview Render book with r code bookdown::render_book(&quot;index.Rmd&quot;) Go into ´docs &gt; index.html` to preview book in Web Browser. Up until now, the book HTML is on the local computer. 1.5 Push code to GitHub Thanks to the docs folder under master branch, once repo is pushed to master the Github Page is live immediately at https://jnlwh.github.io/Ipsum/. After I made some changes, I need to re-render the books and then push to Github for the changes to show on the Github Page. "]
