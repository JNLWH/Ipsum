# Preface {-}

Bookdown package is a simple way to publish a [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) look-and-feel online book and turn it into a static wiki site in no time. 

This is a simple minimum book to test how this works. 

I used a number of sources during this test:

* [Bookdown by Yihui, RStudio](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)
* [Tidyverse Style Guide by Hadley Wickham](https://style.tidyverse.org)
* [Bookdown Starter "Boilerplate" by Sean Kross](http://seankross.com/2016/11/17/How-to-Start-a-Bookdown-Book.html)
* [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
* [Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
* [Lorem Ipsum generator](https://www.lipsum.com)

Sean's Starter Master has proven to be invaluable to kick start a simple Book.
