# Preface {-}

Bookdown R package is a simple way to publish a [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) look-and-feel online book and turn it into a static wiki site in no time. 

This is a simple minimum book to test how this works. 

I used a number of sources during this test:

* [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) by Yihui, RStudio
* Tidyverse [Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org) by Hadley Wickham
* [Bookdown Starter "Boilerplate"](http://seankross.com/2016/11/17/How-to-Start-a-Bookdown-Book.html) by Sean Kross
* [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)
* [Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
* [Lorem Ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com) generator

Sean's Bookdown starter boilerplate has proven to be invaluable to kick start this simple book.
